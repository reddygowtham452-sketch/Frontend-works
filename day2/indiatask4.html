    <h3>LOCATION :-</h3>
    <P1>Location means the specific place or position of something on the Earth’s surface. It helps to identify where a person, object, or place is situated. In geography, location is described using latitude and longitude. Absolute location refers to the exact coordinates of a place. Relative location explains a place in relation to other places, like “near a river” or “next to a school.” Location is very important for maps, navigation, and travel. It also helps in studying climate, culture, and resources of an area. Modern technology like GPS and Google Maps uses location to guide people. Every country, city, or village has its own unique location on the globe. Thus, location helps us connect with the world and understand where things exist.</P1>
    <h3>POPULATION :-</h3>
    <P1>Population means the total number of people living in a particular area or country. It shows how many individuals share the same land, resources, and facilities. The world’s population is measured in billions and keeps increasing every year. Population growth depends on birth rate, death rate, and migration. A high population can lead to problems like unemployment, poverty, and lack of resources. At the same time, a large population provides manpower for development. Population density tells us how crowded a place is by showing people per square kilometer. Countries like India and China have the highest populations in the world. Governments study population through .</P1>

For example, New Delhi is the capital of India, and Washington, D.C. is the capital of the USA. A capital city represents the identity and pride of the nation. It is also a hub for foreign embassies, trade, and communication. Many capitals are developed with modern facilities, transport, and infrastructure.

    <h3>STATES & UTS :- </h3>

Each state has a capital city and is ruled by an elected Chief Minister. The Governor represents the President in every state. Union Territories like Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu & Kashmir have their own legislatures, while others like Chandigarh and Lakshadweep are fully controlled by the Centre.
