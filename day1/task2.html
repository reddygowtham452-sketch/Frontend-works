    <h1>ANIMALS</h1>
    <P1>In a quiet forest, there lived a clever rabbit named Raju.
He was small but very quick, and all the animals admired his intelligence.
One hot afternoon, a hungry lion roamed the forest searching for food.
The lion growled, scaring birds from the trees and deer from the grasslands.
When he saw Raju, he roared, “Today you will be my lunch!”
Raju trembled but quickly thought of a plan to save himself.
He bowed politely and said, “Oh mighty lion, I am ready, but another lion claims to be the king here.”
The lion’s eyes blazed with anger at the thought of a rival.
“Take me to him!” the lion demanded fiercely.
Raju nodded and led the lion to a deep well nearby.
He pointed inside and whispered, “That lion is hiding here.”
The lion peered into the well and saw his own reflection in the water.
He thought it was another lion staring back at him.
Furious, the lion roared loudly into the well.
The echo roared back, making him believe the rival was challenging him.
Without a second thought, the lion leapt into the well.
Splash! He fell deep into the water and could not climb out.
The forest became peaceful once again.
All the animals gathered around Raju, cheering for his cleverness.
The deer danced with joy, and the monkeys clapped their hands.
The birds sang sweet songs in celebration.
Raju smiled humbly and said, “Wisdom is stronger than strength.”
From that day, he was respected as the wisest animal in the forest.
The animals lived happily, free from the lion’s fear.
And Raju’s story was told for generations to inspire courage and intelligence.</P1>

<h2>TYPES OF  <br>   ANIMALS👍</h2>
<P2>Animals are living beings found all over the world.
They can be divided into different types based on their characteristics.
Wild animals like lions, tigers, and elephants live in forests.
Domestic animals like cows, dogs, and cats live with humans.
Pet animals such as rabbits, parrots, and goldfish are kept for companionship.
Herbivores eat only plants, while carnivores eat other animals.
Some animals are omnivores, eating both plants and meat, like bears and humans.
Animals are also grouped as birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.
Each type of animal plays an important role in nature.
Together, all animals help to maintain the balance of our environment.</P2>

<h2>🐯TIGER🐯</h2>
<P2>The tiger is a wild animal and the national animal of India.
It is a strong and powerful creature, known as the king of the jungle.
Tigers have a yellowish-orange body with black stripes.
They are very good hunters and can run fast to catch their prey.
Tigers usually eat deer, wild boar, and other animals.
They live in forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.
A tiger is also an excellent swimmer and enjoys water.
Sadly, tigers are endangered because of hunting and loss of forests.
Many wildlife sanctuaries and national parks protect them.
The tiger is a symbol of bravery, strength, and pride.</P2>
